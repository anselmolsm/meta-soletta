meta-soletta
==============

This is the soletta yocto meta-layer. Soletta Project is a framework for making
IoT devices. With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write
software for devices that control actuators/sensors and communicate using
standard technologies. It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge
devices.

If you have any question or want to propose any a change contact the soletta
project on github: https://github.com/solettaproject/.
